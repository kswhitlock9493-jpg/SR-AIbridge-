          🏃 Bridge Native Self-Hosted Runner Setup Guide
          ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
          
          BENEFITS:
          • Reduce GitHub Actions costs by running on your own infrastructure
          • Use Render.com free tier or local machines for heavy compute
          • Keep lightweight coordination on GitHub-hosted runners
          
          SETUP STEPS:
          
          1. Navigate to: Settings > Actions > Runners > New self-hosted runner
          
          2. Choose your platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)
          
          3. Follow the installation commands provided by GitHub
          
          4. Label your runner as 'bridge-native' for identification
          
          5. Update workflows to use: runs-on: [self-hosted, bridge-native]
          
          RECOMMENDED WORKLOADS FOR SELF-HOSTED RUNNERS:
          • Quantum security checks (quantum_dominion.yml)
          • Token rotation (forge_dominion.yml)
          • Heavy build processes
          • Long-running tests
          
          WORKFLOWS TO KEEP ON GITHUB RUNNERS:
          • Simple CI checks
          • Lightweight validation
          • Quick linting tasks
          
          RENDER.COM INTEGRATION:
          You can run a self-hosted runner on Render's free tier:
          • Create a new Web Service on Render
          • Use Docker with GitHub Actions runner
          • Connect to your repository
          • Configure webhook triggers
