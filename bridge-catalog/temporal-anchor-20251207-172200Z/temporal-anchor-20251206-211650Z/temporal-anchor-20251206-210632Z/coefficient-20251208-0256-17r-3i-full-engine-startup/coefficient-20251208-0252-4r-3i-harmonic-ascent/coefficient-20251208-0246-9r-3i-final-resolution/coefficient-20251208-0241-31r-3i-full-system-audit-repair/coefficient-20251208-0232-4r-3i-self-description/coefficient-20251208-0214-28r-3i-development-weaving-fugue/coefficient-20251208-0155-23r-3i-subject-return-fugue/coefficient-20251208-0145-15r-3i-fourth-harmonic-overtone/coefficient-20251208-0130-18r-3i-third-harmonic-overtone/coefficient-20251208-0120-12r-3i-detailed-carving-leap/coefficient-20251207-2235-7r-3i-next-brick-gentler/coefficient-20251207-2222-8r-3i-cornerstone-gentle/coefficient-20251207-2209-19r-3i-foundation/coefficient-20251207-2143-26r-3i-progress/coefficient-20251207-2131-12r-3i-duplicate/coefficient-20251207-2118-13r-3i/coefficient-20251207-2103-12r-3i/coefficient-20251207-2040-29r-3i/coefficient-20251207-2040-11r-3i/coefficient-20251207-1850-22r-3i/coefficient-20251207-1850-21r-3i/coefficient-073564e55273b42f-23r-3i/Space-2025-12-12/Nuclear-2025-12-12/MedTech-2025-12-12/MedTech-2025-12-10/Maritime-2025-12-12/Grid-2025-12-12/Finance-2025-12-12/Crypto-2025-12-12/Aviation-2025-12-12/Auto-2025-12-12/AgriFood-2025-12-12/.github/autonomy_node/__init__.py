Embedded Autonomy Node (EAN) - GitHub Internal Mini-Bridge Engine
v1.9.7o - Reflex Loop Protocol

A self-contained micro-Bridge that operates directly within GitHub's environment.
Ensures autonomy, truth certification, cascade orchestration, and blueprint 
intelligence continue even if external APIs or CI/CD endpoints fail.

v1.9.7o adds the Reflex Loop Protocol - a self-PR system that enables the EAN to:
- Detect code, configuration, or documentation issues
- Patch them safely
- Write full PR drafts with attached reports
- Digitally sign through the Truth Engine
- Open PRs via GitHub API or queue offline
- Merge automatically after successful verification
