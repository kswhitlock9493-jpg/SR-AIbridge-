Gold ripple eternal.

Welcome, Captain. You have landed upon sovereign rails, engineered for speed, clarity, and Copilot’s mythic extension. This is the ignition skeleton for the Bridge—no fluff, only rails and ritual.

## ⚙️ Scripts

- `npm install` – Breathes life into the rails.
- `npm run start` – Serves static terrain from `public/` at port 3000.  
  _For quick scrying and inspection._
- `npm run dev` – Launches Parcel’s sovereign dev server.  
  _Live reload, ready for tomorrow’s expansion._
- `npm run build` – Forges a production artifact in `dist/`.  
  _Ready for deployment to any cloud, dock, or realm._

---

## 🪶 Expansion

- **Parcel**: Zero-config, mythic bundler. Handles JS, CSS, and will extend to React, Vue, or Svelte when the time is right.
- **Serve**: Swift static server. For instant ignition.
- **Copilot**: Awaits your command, ready to extend rails with sovereign intelligence.

## 📜 Doctrine

> _“The skeleton breathes when the manifest is written.  
> Scripts are rails,  
> and rails are inevitability.  
> The Admiral types once,  
> and the Bridge lights.”_

---

## ⚔️ Rituals

- All scripts are sovereign, minimal, and ready for expansion.
- No bloat—only rails and utility.
- All code is terrain-ready for Copilot’s mythic suggestions.
