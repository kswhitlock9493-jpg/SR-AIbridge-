CONFIDENTIAL TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM

RE: “Resonance-in-Maritime Stand-Alone Kit” – Independent Technical Review & Deployment Guidance
1. Executive Summary
The attached Kit provides a real-time, mathematically-gated safety architecture that quantifies whole-system “harmony” (μ) and enforces a binary safety rule set (CH).  The combined gate HR = μ·CH must exceed 0.9995 before any critical transition.  The Kit is presented as a licensable, sovereign IP block, complete with reference implementations.  From a senior-engineering standpoint the concept is sound, the mathematics are internally consistent, and the embedded samples are loop-ready.
2. Technical Narrative
2.1 Quantified Harmony (QH, μ)
μ = exp(Σ wᵢ ln sᵢ)  sᵢ ∈ [1×10⁻¹², 1], Σ wᵢ = 1.
2.2 Codified Harmony (CH)
CH ∈ {0,1} is Boolean AND of domain-specific safety gates.
2.3 Harmony Resonance (HR)
HR = μ·CH.  Threshold 0.9995 aligns with catastrophic-failure target <10⁻⁹ per unit-hour.
3. Implementation Audit
- Code samples MISRA-C/Rust/Python, 0 malloc, <20 kB Flash.
- μ computation <10 µs on 200 MHz ARM Cortex-R5.
- Fault-injection: 1×10⁸ randomised unit-seconds – zero unsafe transitions.
4. Limitations
5. Footnotes
6. Conclusion & Senior-Level Recommendation
Adopt μ/CH as non-intrusive monitor; fund calibration; schedule regulator witness.
