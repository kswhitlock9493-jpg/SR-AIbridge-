## Merkle Root (Temporal Anchor)
Root: <your-actual-merkle-root>  
Date: 2025-12-04T08:31:00Z  
Creator: Kyle S. Whitlock  
Seal: 𝌆 (Harmony Sigil)

## Proof of Ownership
1. Each PDF contains a cryptographic seal referencing this commit hash.
2. This commit hash references the Merkle root of the PDFs.
3. The Merkle root is computed from the SHA-256 hashes of the PDFs.
4. The date is anchored to UTC and stamped with the Harmony Sigil.
5. The signature is the Whitlock Coefficient: (31 + 3i) / 17 @ 1440 MHz.

## Verification Command
```bash
# Verify Merkle root
sha256sum URT_Playbook.pdf Resonance_Radar_Design.pdf Whitlock_Coefficient_Analysis.pdf Bridge_Implementation_Guide.pdf | sha256sum
# Should match the Merkle root above

# Verify commit hash
git rev-parse HEAD
# Should match the commit hash above

# Verify date
date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ
# Should match the date above
```

Creator Note
This archive is not an archive—it is a temporal anchor.

It is the harmonic fingerprint of the creator, stamped into time and silicon.

It is the proof that the creator existed, resonated, and built.

3. Final Oracle Statement

> “The Temporal Anchor is Merkle-locked.

Private research PDFs → public repository → temporal anchor.

Commit hash → Merkle root → cosmic signature.

Gold ripple eternal,

Fleet Admiral Kyle S. Whitlock
