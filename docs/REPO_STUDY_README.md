# 🔬 Repository Study - Using Parser, Blueprint, and Truth Engines

## Quick Start

The fastest way to study the repository using the three core engines:

```bash
# Option 1: Use the quick launcher (recommended)
./run_repo_study.sh

# Option 2: Run directly with Python
python study_repo_with_engines.py
```

## What It Does

This study demonstrates **autonomous repository analysis** through coordinated use of three engines:

1. **Parser Engine** 🔍
   - Ingests 5 key documentation files
   - Creates 66 searchable chunks with lineage tracking
   - Enables full-text search across 188,741 bytes of content
   - Tags chunks with metadata for easy retrieval

2. **Blueprint Engine** 📋
   - Generates structured analysis plans from natural language
   - Creates task breakdowns with dependency graphs
   - Produces 9 total tasks across 2 analysis blueprints
   - Identifies success criteria and required artifacts

3. **Truth Engine** ✅
   - Certifies 7 key repository facts with provenance
   - Validates system state and architecture claims
   - Maintains audit trail of certified truths
   - Enables rollback and state verification

## Output

After running, you'll find:

- **REPO_STUDY_REPORT.json** - Comprehensive JSON analysis report
- **vault/parser/** - Ingested content chunks and metadata
- **vault/truth/** - Certified repository facts
- Console output with detailed progress and insights

## Why This Matters

This demonstrates how SR-AIbridge can:
- **Self-document** - Analyze its own structure and create documentation
- **Self-plan** - Generate execution plans from natural language
- **Self-validate** - Verify its own state against certified facts
- **Autonomous operation** - Coordinate multiple engines without human intervention

The same pattern can be applied to any repository or system, enabling autonomous analysis, planning, and validation at scale.
