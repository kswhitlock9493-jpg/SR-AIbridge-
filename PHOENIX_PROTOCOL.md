# Phoenix Protocol
## Documented Perfection Rebuild

> **Purpose**: This document tracks the Phoenix Protocol - a complete rebuild of SR-AIbridge from documentation to establish a baseline "documented perfection" implementation for comparison.

---

## 🔥 What is the Phoenix Protocol?

The Phoenix Protocol is a systematic rebuild of SR-AIbridge following **only** the documented specifications in:
- `BUILD_DOSSIER.md` - Step-by-step build guide
- `SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md` - Technical architecture
- `ENGINE_CATALOG.md` - Engine specifications
- `MASTER_ROADMAP.md` - Feature roadmap
- All implementation guides (V196*, V197*, etc.)

**Goal**: Create a reference implementation that:
1. Follows documentation exactly
2. Validates documented architecture works
3. Identifies gaps between docs and current code
4. Provides comparison baseline for current implementation
5. Establishes foundation for future development

- [ ] Database initialization

### Phase 2: Essential Engines (BUILD_DOSSIER Steps 4-5)
- [ ] CalculusCore (Math Engine)
- [ ] Guardian System
- [ ] Health monitoring
- [ ] Self-healing capabilities

### Phase 3: Agent & Mission Management
- [ ] Agent CRUD operations
- [ ] Mission CRUD operations
- [ ] Captain/Agent role separation
- [ ] Fleet management

### Phase 4: Frontend Foundation
- [ ] React app setup with Vite
- [ ] Dashboard component
- [ ] WebSocket integration

## 📊 Comparison Metrics

Once Phoenix rebuild is complete, we'll compare:

| Metric | Current Implementation | Phoenix Build | Delta |
|--------|----------------------|---------------|-------|
| Lines of Code | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| File Count | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Endpoints | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Engines Implemented | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Test Coverage | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Documentation Match | TBD | 100% | TBD |

---

## 🔍 Key Differences to Track

As we build, we'll document:
1. **Missing Features** - What's documented but not implemented
2. **Extra Features** - What's implemented but not documented
3. **Architecture Deviations** - Where current code differs from blueprint
4. **Performance Differences** - Benchmark comparisons
5. **Security Gaps** - Security features in docs vs. implementation

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Run Phoenix Backend
```bash
cd phoenix/backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### Run Phoenix Frontend
```bash
cd phoenix/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Compare with Current
```bash
# Compare file structures
diff -r bridge_backend/ phoenix/backend/

# Compare LOC
wc -l bridge_backend/**/*.py phoenix/backend/**/*.py

# Compare endpoints
curl localhost:8000/docs > current_endpoints.json
curl localhost:8001/docs > phoenix_endpoints.json
diff current_endpoints.json phoenix_endpoints.json
```
